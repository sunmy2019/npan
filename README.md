An network packact analyzer

It reads packets (in hex-stream form) from files, then does the analysis.

Currently I only implemented the following protocals:

### Physical Layer

* Ethernet v2

### Internet Layer

* IPv4
* IPv6 (TODO)

### Transport Layer

* TCP
* UDP (TODO)

### Application Layer

* TLSv1.2 (TODO)
